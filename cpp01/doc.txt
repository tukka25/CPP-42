1) For initialization of non-static const data members:

const data members must be initialized using Initializer List.
In the following example, “t” is a const data member of Test class and is initialized using Initializer List. Reason for initializing
the const data member in the initializer list is because no memory is allocated
separately for const data member, it is folded in the symbol table due to which we
need to initialize it in the initializer list.


2) For initialization of reference members: 
Reference members must be initialized using Initializer List. In the following example, “t” is a reference member
of Test class and is initialized using Initializer List.
